\subsubsection{Optimization of the objective}

Recall the optimization objective, written under the maximum of the log-likelihood:
$$
\begin{align}
    \theta^* &= arg \max_{\theta} \log p_{\theta}(X,T) \\
            &= arg \max_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^n \log p_{\theta}(X_i, T_i) \\
            &= arg \max_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^n \log p_{\theta}(T_i) + \log p_{\theta}(X_i | T_i)
\end{align}
$$

Notice that, in our context, this objective is separable since the prior and posterior do not share any common parameter in $\theta$.
Hence, the optimal $\theta^*$ is given by the concatenation of the MLE from the prior on the trees and the posterior of the abundance knowning the trees,
which we both have computed in the previous sections.

\subsubsection{Experiments}

We have implemented the previous modelization and tested it on a large microbiota dataset.

\subsubsection{Conclusions}

This first model is interesting as it provides a benchmark baseline for our upcoming tree-structured models.
However, it clearly lacks of complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The nodes are modeled as independent, which prevents any modelisation of correlation between entities.
          As for many ecosystems, we would expect some bacteria to have symbiotic relationship, or domination roles,
          especially when it comes to critical systems like disease detection in which some bacteria may proliferate over others.
          One idea could be to model an interaction graph (see \cite{momal_tree}) and use it as a correlation restriction between our bacteria.
    \item The abundance data generation takes the tree constraints into account, but the Dirichlet distribution is not quite expressive.
          Mixture models could enable us to provide more expressive priors and model multiple modes rather than one at the moment, to the cost of more parameters though.
    \item So far we have only considered trees without any missing entries at precision level $L$, which is not what we observe for microbiota datasets.
          Inference for missing data implementation could be interesting in the future.
\end{itemize}
